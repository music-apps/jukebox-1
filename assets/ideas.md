- Weighting video selection to encourage variety
    - Have videos() select 100, then weight them in javascript
    - Use play_count, vote_count, and last_played (and date_added?)
    - System must not result in all the "bad" videos constantly coming up
        - Consistently not voting for a bad video should decrease its chances
        - Maybe add a 'rating' column to the DB
- Idle games/activities embedded on the page
    - Whiteboard or some way to mark up the video, maybe placing "stickers"
    - Generated trivia/math/misc questions?
    - Jackpot won by guessing the exact number of seconds that the total playtime of the selection is?
    - Kudo bank to gain interest?
- Multiple color themes with selector
- Animate random synced events like a bird flying in and landing on a button
    - Click bird to shoo (also synced, and get kudos)
    - Use flash to animate them, flat colors with .gif format
        - Flying in/away animation uses large gif positioned in the right spot
