- Weighting video selection to encourage variety
  - Have videos() select 100, then weight them in javascript
  - Use play_count, vote_count, and last_played (and date_added?)
  - System must not result in all the "bad" videos constantly coming up
    - Consistently not voting for a bad video should decrease its chances
    - Maybe add a 'rating' column to the DB
- Idle games/activities embedded on the page
  - Whiteboard or some way to mark up the video, maybe placing "stickers"
  - Generated trivia/math/misc questions?
  - Jackpot won by guessing the exact number of seconds that the total playtime of the selection is?
  - Kudo bank to gain interest?
- Gain money from people voting on your songs
